## Make apk from a website now!

**Deploy website to playstore-**

1. Hybrid web view app using Ionic (but downside is that we would need to )
2. Use TWA (trusted web activites) REFER MY [OWN REPO TO SEE THIS AWESOME WAY](https://github.com/sahilrajput03/pwa-to-apk-using-twa/tree/main).

**FYI:**

- Inspiration: [Jeff - Fireship.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JDFjeMvxos).
- Also this is a very genuine desire for all web developers to be ablet to ship apk to playstore successfully to provide fullscreen experience. So it works really good IMO. **Checkout my own generated [apk here](https://github.com/sahilrajput03/pwa-to-apk-using-twa/raw/main/bw.apk).**

**This is pretty solid(coz it can generate apk{for playstore distributio}, appix{for windows stores} and ios packages as well for ios store ditribution, BUT USING MY OWN WAY OF APK DEVELOPMENT IS BEST ~ IMO ~ SAHIL):**
